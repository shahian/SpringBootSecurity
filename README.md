# SpringBootSecurity

Spring Boot Security is a framework for implementing security in a Spring Boot application. It provides a comprehensive security solution for securing both the frontend and backend of an application. It has a wide range of features such as authentication, authorization, role-based access control, password hashing, encryption, and more. It also provides a secure way to store and access user credentials. Spring Boot Security is easy to configure and provides a secure environment for applications.

### webSecurityConfigurerAdapter
***
Spring Security provides an implementation of the WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter class that can be used to configure web-based security for specific http requests. This class is used to apply security controls to specific http requests based on the specified URL patterns. The WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter class provides methods to configure authentication and authorization for web applications.

The WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter class allows for configuration of authentication and authorization for specific URLs. It also provides methods for configuring roles and access control for specific URLs. The WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter class can be used to protect against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks by configuring CsrfTokenRepository. It also provides methods for configuring encryption, such as HTTPS and TLS.

The WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter class can be used to provide additional security features such as filtering, session management, and access control. It also provides methods for configuring authentication providers and authorization constraints. Furthermore, the WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter class can be used to provide custom security rules for specific URLs.

### configureMethod
***
The configure(WebSecurity) method in the WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter class is used to specify the security configuration for the application. The configure(WebSecurity) method can be overridden in order to customize the security configuration as needed. This allows developers to specify custom authentication providers, configure access control rules, and more. By overriding the configure(WebSecurity) method, developers can tailor security configuration to the specific needs of the application.


### JWT
***
JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. In Spring Boot applications, JWT is used to secure communication between client and server by using digitally signed tokens. The token is sent as an Authorization header in each request, and is used to authenticate the user and authorize them to access certain API endpoints.

### JWTConfiguration
***
To use JWT for authentication in a Java Spring Boot application, you will need to build a custom authentication filter to validate the token. The filter should check for a valid JWT in the Authorization header of the request and extract the user information from the JWT. The user information should then be used to set the SecurityContext for the request. 

The following steps may help you to implement this:

1. Create a custom authentication filter class that will extend the OncePerRequestFilter class. 

2. In the doFilterInternal() method of the filter, check for a valid JWT in the Authorization header of the request.

3. If the token is valid, parse the JWT and extract the user information.

4. Create an Authentication object with the user information and set it in the SecurityContext for the request.

5. Return the response with a successful authentication status.

6. If the token is not valid, return an appropriate status code.

7. Configure the custom authentication filter in the application configuration.

You may also need to implement other features such as token refresh, token revocation, etc.
